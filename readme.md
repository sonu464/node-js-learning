WHAT IS NODEJS :-
These all lines are written accourding to me and by online studies-

- There is an V8 engine inside chrome, and this v8 engine is take out from chrome and this v8 engine is written in c++ language but there we use this engine to create server but there is problem we need to know about c++ language and make server by using c++ language,
- After that a code which is written in js is wrap on v8 engine and than whole part is called NodeJs.
- Basically we said that the js code is going written by programmer is firstly going to wrapper part of node js than it will pass to v8 engine after that the code is in wordink or we said that our server is generated and this server is in runnable state whenever the node (v8 engine + js wrapper) is in running state.
